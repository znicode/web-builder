A development toolkit that leverages Gulp.js to streamline Bootstrap-based web development. It offers automation,
customization, and productivity enhancements to help you build web applications faster and more efficiently.

## Usage

**Start development**

Development mode: execute the build task and start the local server, automatically refresh the page when the file is
modified.

```shell
npm start
```

**Run the build**

Build mode: only the build task is executed, but the compression option is enabled during the build process.

```shell
npm run build
```
